## Features

Here are just a few of LuccaNotes' awesome features:

- **GitHub Flavored Markdown**: The best flavor of Markdown! The GFM spec is supported by LuccaNotes' text editor and Markdown renderer for note previews.
- **Auto-saving**: Changes to your notes are automatically saved to LuccaNotes' backend, meaning you'll never need to worry about losing your work.
- **Tags keep notes tidy**: Our tagging system allows you to effortlessly group, organize, and search through your notes - regardless if you have 5 or 5000!
- **Note previews**: The toggleable Markdown preview displays a fully rendered version of your note's content as you type it out in the text editor.
- **Keyboard navigation & a11y**: LuccaNotes is built with full accessibility in mind. In addition to a more inclusive UX, this allows for speedy keyboard navigation throughout the entire app.
- **Sort, Filter & Search**: A sensible and easy-to-use search tool lets you quickly browse your collection and find the note you're looking for. It's as simple as that!

## Deploying

LuccaNotes' live demo is deployed on Vercel (Next.js app) and Supabase (PostgreSQL database), but any hosting services with support for Next.js and/or PostgreSQL should work fine.

**First, set up your database.** To deploy on Supabase, first create a new project. Once it's set up, go to Project Settings -> Database -> Connection String. Copy the Node.js connection string and temporarily change it your local `.env`, then push your Prisma schema by running `npx prisma db push` locally.

**Now, the Next.js app.** To deploy on Vercel, simply visit your [dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard), select your GitHub repo, set up your environment variables, and voil√†!
